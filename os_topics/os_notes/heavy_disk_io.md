The output of the `strace` command indicates that the process with PID `2623` is performing **write** operations. Here's what it means:

---

### **Understanding the Output**
- **`write(24, "\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0", 8) = 8`**:
  - **`write`**: System call being traced, used to write data to a file descriptor.
  - **`24`**: File descriptor (FD) to which the data is being written.
  - **`"\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"`**: The actual data being written (in this case, binary data).
  - **`8`**: Number of bytes written.
  - **`= 8`**: The result of the write call (successfully wrote 8 bytes).

---

### **Identifying the File Descriptor**
To determine which file corresponds to file descriptor `24`, use the `/proc/<PID>/fd` directory:

#### Command:
```bash
ls -l /proc/2623/fd/24
```

#### Example Output:
```
lrwx------ 1 root root 64 Oct 12 01:10 /proc/2623/fd/24 -> /path/to/actual/file
```

This resolves FD `24` to the actual file or resource being written to.

---

### **If the FD Points to a Pipe or Socket**
If the file descriptor points to a pipe (`pipe:[12345]`) or socket (`socket:[56789]`), it indicates inter-process communication or network activity. Use the following to identify more details:

1. **Check Pipes or Sockets**:
   ```bash
   ls -l /proc/2623/fd | grep pipe
   ls -l /proc/2623/fd | grep socket
   ```

2. **Use `netstat` for Network Connections**:
   ```bash
   sudo netstat -anp | grep 2623
   ```

---

### **Next Steps**
1. **If it’s writing to a regular file**:
   - Inspect the file using tools like `cat`, `tail`, or `less`.
2. **If it’s writing to a socket or pipe**:
   - Use tools like `tcpdump` or `wireshark` to analyze network activity.
   - Check the process using the other end of the pipe.

To find out which files a process is writing to, you can use the following methods:

---

### **1. Use `lsof` Command**
The `lsof` (list open files) command can show files currently opened by a process:

#### Syntax:
```bash
lsof -p <PID>
```

#### Example:
```bash
lsof -p 2623
```

- Look for entries in the output under the `TYPE` column labeled as `REG` (regular file).
- Check the `FD` (file descriptor) column for write-related descriptors:
  - `w`: Writing.
  - `u`: Read/write.
  - `append`: Appending to a file.

#### Filter for specific actions like writing:
```bash
lsof -p 2623 | grep -i "w"
```

---

### **2. Use `strace` to Monitor System Calls**
The `strace` command can trace system calls made by a process, including file writes.

#### Syntax:
```bash
strace -p <PID> -e trace=open,write,fsync
```

#### Example:
```bash
strace -p 2623 -e trace=open,write,fsync
```

- **`open`**: Lists files being opened by the process.
- **`write`**: Captures details of write operations.
- **`fsync`**: Tracks file synchronization calls.

#### Save output to a file for analysis:
```bash
strace -p 2623 -e trace=open,write,fsync -o strace_output.txt
```

---

### **3. Use `iotop` to Monitor Real-Time Disk I/O**
The `iotop` tool can show real-time disk I/O activity, including processes writing to disk:

```bash
sudo iotop
```

- Look for the `PID` of the process and note the files or directories associated with its activity.

---

### **4. Check `/proc/<PID>/fd` for Opened File Descriptors**
The `/proc` directory contains runtime information about processes, including opened file descriptors.

#### Syntax:
```bash
ls -l /proc/<PID>/fd
```

#### Example:
```bash
ls -l /proc/2623/fd
```

- This lists all file descriptors opened by the process.
- Look for symbolic links pointing to files on the disk.

#### To filter for writable files:
```bash
ls -l /proc/2623/fd | grep -i "w"
```

---

### **5. Combine `inotifywait` for File Activity**
You can monitor specific directories where the process might be writing files using `inotifywait`.

#### Syntax:
```bash
inotifywait -m <directory_path>
```

#### Example:
If you suspect Chrome is writing to `/tmp`, run:
```bash
inotifywait -m /tmp
```

---

### **6. Use Chrome-Specific Logs**
Since the process in question is `chrome`, it could be writing temporary files or logs in the following directories:
- **Linux cache directory**: 
  ```bash
  ~/.cache/google-chrome/
  ```
- **System-wide temporary directory**:
  ```bash
  /tmp/
  ```

---

### Suggested Workflow
1. Start with `lsof` to identify active files.
2. Use `strace` to monitor writes in real-time.
3. Use `iotop` to track disk-intensive processes.
4. Explore `/proc/<PID>/fd` for detailed open files.
