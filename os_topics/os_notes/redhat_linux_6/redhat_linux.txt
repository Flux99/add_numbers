When using ps aux, process information is shown in different columns:

USER: The name of the user whose identity is used to run the process.
PID: The process identification number, a unique number required to manage processes.
%CPU: The percentage of CPU cycles used by the process.
%MEM: The percentage of memory used by the process.
VSZ: The virtual memory size, representing the total amount of memory claimed by the process. Often, this is more than what is actually needed, known as memory over-allocation.
RSS: The resident memory size, indicating the actual amount of memory used by the process.
TTY: The device name of the terminal if the process was started from a terminal.
STAT: The current status of the process. Common statuses include:
S: Sleeping
R: Running
Z: Zombie state
START: The time the process started.
TIME: The cumulative real time (in seconds) the process has used CPU cycles since it started.
COMMAND: The name of the command file used to start the process. If enclosed in brackets, it is a kernel process.


commands to kill the process
Hereâ€™s a summary of the key points on managing processes with signals:

1. **Common Signals**:
   - **SIGHUP (1)**: Tells a process to reinitialize and reread configuration files.
   - **SIGKILL (9)**: Forcefully stops a process immediately without cleanup; risk of data loss if open files are not properly closed.
   - **SIGTERM (15)**: Politely requests a process to terminate, allowing it to close files and release resources. Preferred for graceful shutdown.

2. **Using the `kill` Command**:
   - Format: `kill [signal] [PID]`
   - Example: `kill -9 123` or `kill -SIGKILL 123` to send the SIGKILL signal to process with PID 123.
   - You can send signals to multiple PIDs at once.

3. **Using `killall` for Multiple Processes**:
   - Format: `killall [signal] [process name]`
   - Example: `killall -SIGTERM httpd` sends SIGTERM to all active `httpd` processes.
  
These commands allow administrators to manage processes by stopping, restarting, or reloading configurations effectively.
