# Getting Started with Shell Scripting

A **shell script** is a text file containing a sequence of commands for the shell to execute. To create quality scripts that are both functional and readable, consider the following recommendations:

## Elements of a Good Shell Script

1. **Unique Name**: Ensure the script name does not conflict with existing commands. Use the `which` command to verify its uniqueness.
   
   ```bash
   which your_script_name
   ```

2. **Shebang**: Include a shebang (`#!`) at the top of your script to specify which shell should execute the script. For example, to use Bash:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   ```

3. **Comments**: Use comments generously to explain the purpose and functionality of your script. Comments start with a `#`.

4. **Exit Command**: Use the `exit` command to indicate successful execution (exit code `0`) or an error (non-zero exit code).

5. **Executable**: Ensure the script is executable. You can set the executable permission using:

   ```bash
   chmod +x your_script_name
   ```

## Exercise 18.1: Creating Your First Shell Script

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Open your terminal.

2. Create a new script file named `hello` in your home directory.

   ```bash
   touch ~/hello
   ```

3. Open the file in a text editor (e.g., `nano`, `vim`, `gedit`):

   ```bash
   nano ~/hello
   ```

4. Add the following code to the `hello` script:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # this is the hello script
   # run it by typing ./hello in the directory where you've found it
   clear
   echo hello world
   exit 0
   ```

5. Save the file and exit the editor.

6. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/hello
   ```

7. Run the script by typing:

   ```bash
   ./hello
   ```

### Explanation of the Script

- **Shebang (`#!/bin/bash`)**: Informs the system to use Bash to execute the script.
- **Comments**: Explain the script's purpose and how to execute it.
- **`clear`**: Clears the terminal screen before displaying the message.
- **`echo hello world`**: Outputs "hello world" to the terminal.
- **`exit 0`**: Signals successful execution of the script.

## Additional Notes

- Scripts without a shebang will execute in the current shell, making them less portable.
- It's good practice to use exit codes for error handling, where `exit 0` indicates success and other numbers indicate various errors.

By following these guidelines and completing the exercise, you'll have a foundational understanding of shell scripting and its best practices. Happy scripting!



This text provides a comprehensive overview of executing shell scripts, using variables, and managing input in Bash scripting. Here's a concise summary of the key points, which can serve as a reference or study guide:

### Executing Shell Scripts

There are three primary ways to execute a shell script:

1. **Making the Script Executable:**
   - Use the command:
     ```bash
     chmod +x hello
     ```
   - Run the script using its path:
     - If in the current directory:
       ```bash
       ./hello
       ```
     - If not in the current directory, use the full path:
       ```bash
       /home/linda/hello
       ```
   - To check if a directory is in your PATH, use:
     ```bash
     echo $PATH
     ```
   - To add a directory to your PATH:
     ```bash
     PATH=$PATH:/something
     ```

2. **Running as an Argument of the Bash Command:**
   - Execute the script with the `bash` command:
     ```bash
     bash hello
     ```
   - Use the complete path if the script is not in the current directory:
     ```bash
     bash /home/linda/hello
     ```

3. **Sourcing the Script:**
   - Sourcing runs the script in the current shell, allowing variables to persist:
     - Use either:
       ```bash
       . settings
       ```
       or 
       ```bash
       source settings
       ```
   - Be cautious: if the script contains an `exit` command, it will close the current shell.

### Working with Variables and Input

#### Defining and Using Variables
- Variables are defined using the format:
  ```bash
  varname=value
  ```
- Access the value using:
  ```bash
  echo $varname
  ```
- Example:
  ```bash
  HAPPY=yes
  echo $HAPPY
  ```

#### Environment Variables
- These are automatically set when logging in. Use:
  ```bash
  env
  ```
  to see a list of all environment variables.
- It's a good practice to use uppercase for variable names to improve readability.

#### Advantages of Using Variables
- **Single Point of Administration:** Changes need to be made only in one location.
- **User-Provided Values:** Variables can hold values input by users.
- **Dynamic Values:** Variables can store values calculated at runtime.

### Example Script with Variables
Here’s a simple script demonstrating variable usage:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#
# dirscript
#
# Script that creates a directory, sets ownership, and changes permissions
DIRECTORY=/blah474
USER=linda
GROUP=sales

mkdir $DIRECTORY
chown $USER $DIRECTORY
chgrp $GROUP $DIRECTORY
chmod 770 $DIRECTORY

exit 0
```

### Key Takeaways
- Understanding how to execute scripts and manage variables is essential for effective Bash scripting.
- Using variables increases the flexibility and maintainability of scripts.
- Be cautious when sourcing scripts, especially if they contain commands that may affect the current shell environment.

This structured overview should help in both executing and writing efficient shell scripts while leveraging the power of variables.

It looks like you've provided a detailed explanation about defining and using variables in Bash scripting, as well as working with script arguments. This information is great for someone learning shell scripting. To summarize and clarify some of the concepts you've outlined:

### Variables in Bash

1. **Defining Variables**:
   - Variables are local to the shell where they are defined.
   - If you start a subshell (e.g., using `bash`), the variables defined in the parent shell are not accessible in the subshell.

2. **Exporting Variables**:
   - To make a variable available in subshells, you use the `export` command.
   - This ensures the variable persists across subshells but still cannot be accessed in parent shells.

3. **Sourcing Files**:
   - You can use the `.` (dot) or `source` command to include variables from another file into the current shell.
   - Sourcing a file runs its commands in the current shell, unlike executing a file (using `./`), which starts a new subshell.

### Example of Variables and Sourcing

- Define a variable:
   ```bash
   HAPPY=yes
   ```
   Access it:
   ```bash
   echo $HAPPY  # Output: yes
   ```

- Start a subshell:
   ```bash
   bash
   echo $HAPPY  # Output: (no output, variable not available)
   exit
   ```

- Export a variable:
   ```bash
   export HAPPY=yes
   bash
   echo $HAPPY  # Output: yes (variable available in subshell)
   exit
   ```

- Sourcing a file:
   ```bash
   # vars file
   HAPPY=yes
   ANGRY=no
   SUNNY=yes

   . vars  # or source vars
   echo $HAPPY  # Output: yes
   ```

### Working with Script Arguments

1. **Using Arguments in Scripts**:
   - You can access script arguments using `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, etc. `$0` refers to the script's name.
   - This allows for dynamic input when executing scripts.

2. **Counting Arguments**:
   - Use `$#` to get the number of arguments passed to a script. This can be useful for validation.

### Example Scripts

**Example Script to Use Arguments**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
#
# argscript
#
ARG1=$1
ARG2=$2
ARG3=$3
SCRIPTNAME=$0
echo The name of this script is $SCRIPTNAME
echo The first argument used is $ARG1
echo The second argument used is $ARG2
echo The third argument used is $ARG3
exit 0
```

**Dynamic Directory Creation Script**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
#
# dirscript2
#
DIRECTORY=$1
USER=$2
GROUP=$3
mkdir /$DIRECTORY
chown $USER $DIRECTORY
chgrp $GROUP $DIRECTORY
chmod 770 $DIRECTORY
exit 0
```

**Counting Arguments Script**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
#
# countargs
#
echo The number of arguments is $#
exit 0
```

### Execution Examples

- To execute the argument script:
  ```bash
  ./argscript arg1 arg2 arg3
  ```

- To run the directory creation script:
  ```bash
  ./dirscript2 mydir myuser mygroup
  ```

- To count arguments:
  ```bash
  ./countargs a b c d
  ```

The expected output will show how many arguments were passed to the script.

### Important Notes

- Always ensure to provide clear documentation or help messages within scripts to avoid confusion, especially when dealing with multiple arguments.
- Remember to handle edge cases, such as missing arguments, to make your scripts robust and user-friendly.

Feel free to ask if you have any specific questions or need further explanations on any of these topics!


The section you've provided covers several important concepts in Bash scripting, particularly related to handling script arguments, user input, command substitution, and variable substitution operators. Here’s a summary of the key points, along with explanations and examples for better clarity.

### 1. Handling Script Arguments: `$@` vs. `$*`

- **`$@`**: Represents all the arguments passed to a script as individual quoted strings.
- **`$*`**: Represents all the arguments passed to a script as a single string.

**Example**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# showargs.sh

echo "Using \$@:"
for arg in "$@"; do
    echo "$arg"
done

echo "Using \$*:"
for arg in "$*"; do
    echo "$arg"
done
```

When you run `./showargs.sh a b c`, the output would be:
```
Using $@:
a
b
c
Using $*:
a b c
```

### 2. Asking for User Input

You can prompt the user for input using the `read` command. The input is stored in a variable for later use.

**Example**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# askinput.sh

echo "Enter some text:"
read SOMETEXT
echo -e "You have entered the following text:\t$SOMETEXT"
```

When executed, if the user inputs "Hello World", the output would be:
```
You have entered the following text:   Hello World
```

### 3. Special Characters and Echo

When using `echo`, you can enable interpretation of backslash escapes with the `-e` option. This allows for formatting like tabs and newlines.

**Example**:
```bash
echo -e "Hello\nWorld"   # Outputs "Hello" on one line and "World" on the next
echo -e "Hello\tWorld"   # Outputs "Hello" and "World" separated by a tab
```

### 4. Command Substitution

Command substitution allows you to use the output of a command as an input in your script. You can do this using either backticks (`` `command` ``) or `$(command)`.

**Example**:
```bash
TODAY=$(date +%d-%m-%y)
echo "Today is $TODAY"
```

### 5. Substitution Operators

Bash provides substitution operators to manage variable values effectively. Here’s a brief overview of their functionality:

| Operator                   | Description                                                                                      |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `${parameter:-value}`      | Displays `value` if `parameter` is not defined.                                                |
| `${parameter=value}`       | Assigns `value` to `parameter` if `parameter` does not exist.                                  |
| `${parameter:=value}`      | Assigns `value` if `parameter` is empty or not defined.                                        |
| `${parameter:?value}`      | Displays `value` and aborts the script if `parameter` does not exist or is empty.             |
| `${parameter:+value}`      | Displays `value` if `parameter` has a value, otherwise does nothing.                           |

**Example**:
```bash
echo $BLAH                # Initially empty
echo ${BLAH:-"Variable is empty"}  # Outputs "Variable is empty"
BLAH="Hello"
echo ${BLAH:=value}      # Assigns "Hello" (no change)
echo ${BLAH:+sometext}   # Outputs "sometext" since BLAH is not empty
```

### Conclusion

These concepts are fundamental for creating robust Bash scripts that can handle dynamic inputs and manage variables effectively. Understanding how to differentiate between `$@` and `$*`, how to solicit user input, and the utility of command substitution and substitution operators will greatly enhance your scripting capabilities. 

Feel free to ask if you have any questions about specific examples or concepts!


Here's a concise summary of the key points about performing calculations and using control structures in Bash scripting:

### Performing Calculations

Bash provides several methods for performing calculations in scripts:

1. **Using Arithmetic Expansion**:
   - You can use the `$((...))` syntax to perform calculations directly.
   ```bash
   # Example
   counter=1
   counter=$((counter + 1))
   echo "Counter is set to $counter"
   ```

2. **Using the `expr` Command**:
   - `expr` can be used for basic arithmetic operations but requires escaping the `*` operator.
   ```bash
   sum=$(expr 1 + 2)  # Use backticks for older syntax: sum=`expr 1 + 2`
   echo $sum
   ```

3. **Using the `let` Command**:
   - `let` allows for calculations without needing to echo the result explicitly.
   ```bash
   let x="1 + 2"
   echo $x
   ```

4. **Using Command Substitution**:
   - You can use `$(...)` for command substitution, which is similar to `let`.
   ```bash
   x=$(($1 $2 $3))  # where $1, $2, and $3 are passed as arguments
   echo $x
   ```

### Control Structures

Bash supports several control structures for flow control:

1. **If Statements**:
   - Basic syntax for if-then-else:
   ```bash
   if [ condition ]; then
       command1
   else
       command2
   fi
   ```
   - Example checking for an argument:
   ```bash
   if [ -z "$1" ]; then
       echo "You have to provide an argument with this command"
       exit 1
   fi
   echo "The argument is $1"
   ```

2. **Nested If Statements**:
   - You can use `elif` to check multiple conditions:
   ```bash
   if [ -f "$1" ]; then
       echo "$1 is a file"
   elif [ -d "$1" ]; then
       echo "$1 is a directory"
   else
       echo "I don't know what $1 is"
   fi
   ```

3. **Test Command**:
   - The `test` command (or `[...]` syntax) can be used for various checks:
   - Check if a file exists, if it's a directory, if variables are empty, and compare integers.
   ```bash
   test -e "$1"  # Check if file exists
   [ -f "$1" ]   # Check if it's a regular file
   [ -z "$var" ] # Check if variable is empty
   ```

### Conclusion

Using these techniques, you can effectively perform calculations and control the flow of execution in your Bash scripts. These constructs are foundational for scripting tasks, enabling conditional execution and iteration over actions.


This text provides a comprehensive overview of control structures in Bash scripting, specifically focusing on case statements, while loops, until loops, and for loops. Here's a summary and breakdown of the key points:

### **1. Using Case Statements**

- **Purpose:** To handle different user inputs in a controlled manner.
- **Variable Naming:** Use uppercase for variable names (e.g., `$COUNTRY`) for easy identification.
- **Input Handling:** Convert user input to uppercase to ensure case sensitivity does not affect the logic.
- **Structure:** 
  ```bash
  case $VARIABLE in
      option1 | option2)
          # commands
          ;;
      *)
          echo "Default message"
          ;;
  esac
  ```
- **Tip:** Always handle unexpected inputs with a wildcard (`*`).

### **2. Using While Loops**

- **Purpose:** To continuously execute commands as long as a condition is met.
- **Example Script: Monitoring Process Activity**
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  while ps aux | grep $1
  do
      sleep 1
  done
  logger "$1 is no longer present"
  exit 0
  ```
- **Usage:** Commonly used for monitoring processes or IP addresses with the help of `sleep` to pause execution.

### **3. Using Until Loops**

- **Purpose:** Runs commands until a specified condition becomes true.
- **Example Script: Monitoring User Login**
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  until who | grep $1 >> /dev/null
  do
      echo "$1 is not logged in yet"
      sleep 5
  done
  echo "$1 has just logged in"
  exit 0
  ```

### **4. Using For Loops**

- **Purpose:** To execute a set of commands for a specific number of times or for each element in a list.
- **Example Script: Counter**
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  for (( counter=1; counter<10; counter++ ))
  do
      echo "The counter is now set to $counter"
  done
  exit 0
  ```
- **Example Script: Listing Users from /etc/passwd (Faulty)**
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  for i in `cat /etc/passwd`
  do
      echo $i
  done
  exit 0
  ```
  - **Note:** This script does not handle spaces correctly.

### **5. Finding All Available IP Addresses**
- **Example Script: Ping a Range of IPs**
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  for i in "$@"
  do
      ping -c 1 192.168.1.$i
  done
  ```
- **Using `$@`:** Refers to all arguments passed to the script.

### **6. Differences between `$@` and `$***`
- **`$@`:** Treats each argument as a separate entity.
- **`$*`:** Treats all arguments as a single string.

### **7. Example Script to Evaluate `$@` and `$***`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo showing for on \$@
for i in "$@"
do
    echo $i
done
echo showing for on \$*
for i in "$*"
do
    echo $i
done
exit 0
```
- **Escaping Characters:** Use backslashes to prevent the shell from interpreting special characters.

### **Conclusion**
- Bash scripts can leverage control structures effectively to handle user input and automate tasks. Understanding the proper use of case, while, until, and for loops can greatly enhance the functionality of your scripts.
- Experimenting with these scripts can help in grasping their behaviors and nuances. 

### **Exercises**
- Practice creating scripts based on the examples provided to monitor processes, check user logins, and manage IP addresses.
- Modify scripts to add additional functionalities or handle unexpected input scenarios.

This summary encapsulates the key elements of the provided Bash scripting content, making it easier for you to grasp the core concepts and their applications. If you have any specific questions or need further clarifications on any part, feel free to ask!
