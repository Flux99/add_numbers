# **Memory Usage Analysis and Troubleshooting Guide**

## **Key Concepts**
### **Memory Metrics**
- **USS (Unique Set Size):** Memory uniquely used by a process.
- **PSS (Proportional Set Size):** Shared memory proportionally attributed to the process.
- **RSS (Resident Set Size):** Total physical memory used by the process.
- **Swap:** Swap space used by the process.

---

## **Analyzing Memory-Intensive Processes**

### **Steps to Identify High Memory Usage**
1. **List Processes by Memory Usage (`ps`):**
   ```bash
   ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -n 10
   ```
   - Shows the top 10 memory-hungry processes sorted by `%MEM`.
   - Focus on the `COMMAND` column to understand how the process was started.

2. **Interactive Monitoring (`top`):**
   ```bash
   top
   ```
   - Press `M` to sort by memory usage.
   - Press `c` to toggle full command-line display.

3. **Enhanced Monitoring (`htop`):**
   ```bash
   htop
   ```
   - Press `F6` to sort by `%MEM` or `F5` for tree view to understand parent-child relationships.

---

## **Investigating Specific Processes**
### **Command and Working Directory**
1. **Command-Line Arguments:**
   ```bash
   cat /proc/<PID>/cmdline
   ```
   - Shows the exact command used to start the process.

2. **Working Directory:**
   ```bash
   ls -l /proc/<PID>/cwd
   ```
   - Displays the current working directory of the process.

3. **Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   cat /proc/<PID>/environ | tr '\0' '\n'
   ```
   - Reveals environment variables used by the process.

### **Parent Process**
- Find the Parent PID (PPID):
  ```bash
  awk '{print $4}' /proc/<PID>/stat
  ```
- Investigate the parent process in `/proc/<PPID>` for its details.

### **Open Files:**
- List files opened by the process:
  ```bash
  lsof -p <PID>
  ```

---

## **Additional Tools**
### **Memory Overview**
1. **System Memory Usage:**
   ```bash
   free -h
   ```
   - Displays total memory usage summary.

2. **Memory Map of a Process:**
   ```bash
   pmap <PID>
   ```
   - Provides a detailed memory map of the process.

### **Runtime Logs**
- Find logs for a process:
  ```bash
  journalctl _PID=<PID>
  ```

### **Monitor Resource Utilization Over Time**
- Install `sysstat` package:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install sysstat
  ```
- Use `pidstat` to track memory usage:
  ```bash
  pidstat -r -p <PID> 1
  ```

### **Trace System Calls:**
- Attach `strace` to the process:
  ```bash
  strace -p <PID>
  ```

---

## **Automated Memory Leak Detection**
### **Using `smem`:**
```bash
smem --sort=uss | head -n 10
```
- Reports unique memory usage per process.

### **Using `valgrind`:**
- Attach to a debug process to analyze potential memory leaks:
  ```bash
  valgrind --leak-check=full --track-origins=yes <command>
  ```

---

## **Steps to Investigate the Memory-Hogging Process**
1. Identify the process using tools like `ps`, `top`, or `htop`.
2. Use `/proc/<PID>` to gather detailed information:
   - `cmdline`: Command used to start.
   - `cwd`: Current working directory.
   - `environ`: Environment variables.
3. Check logs (`journalctl`, `lsof`) for historical or runtime insights.
4. Investigate dependencies or child processes using:
   - `htop` tree view.
   - `strace` for real-time system call monitoring.
5. Analyze for memory leaks using tools like `smem` or `valgrind`.

---

## **Common Issues**
### **Broken Pipe Error**
- **Cause**: Receiver process (e.g., `head`) exits before the sender process (e.g., `smem`) finishes.
- **Fix**:
  ```bash
  smem --sort=uss | head -n 10 2>/dev/null
  ```

By systematically using these tools and techniques, you can effectively identify, analyze, and resolve memory-intensive processes, ensuring system stability and performance.

If a production host is shutting down intermittently due to **Out of Memory (OOM)** issues, it's crucial to take a systematic approach to identify the root causes and find solutions. Here are additional troubleshooting steps you can take to diagnose and mitigate the OOM issues:

### **1. Review System Logs for OOM Events**
- **Check the OOM killer logs**:
  The OOM killer is responsible for terminating processes when the system runs out of memory. To find which processes are being killed, you can check the system logs.
  ```bash
  dmesg | grep -i oom
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  journalctl | grep -i oom
  ```
  This will show when and which processes were terminated due to an OOM condition.

- **Check `syslog` or `messages`**:
  ```bash
  tail -f /var/log/syslog
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  tail -f /var/log/messages
  ```
  These logs may contain more details about the OOM events.

---

### **2. Monitor Memory Usage Over Time**
- **Enable memory usage monitoring**:
  Set up memory usage monitoring using tools like `vmstat`, `sar`, or `collectd` to get a historical view of memory usage.
  - `vmstat` (for real-time memory statistics):
    ```bash
    vmstat 1
    ```
  - **Set up `sar`** for historical data collection:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install sysstat
    sar -r 1 10
    ```
  - **`collectd`**: Set up `collectd` to log memory usage data over time, allowing you to analyze memory spikes leading to OOM events.

---

### **3. Analyze and Optimize Memory Usage**
- **Memory Leak Detection**:
  - **Use `smem`** for unique memory usage:
    ```bash
    smem --sort=uss | head -n 10
    ```
  - **Use `valgrind`** to check for memory leaks in applications, especially for custom or long-running services that might be consuming increasing amounts of memory.

- **Check for Processes with High Memory Usage**:
  - Use `ps` or `top` to identify memory-hogging processes:
    ```bash
    ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -n 10
    ```
    - Look for processes that gradually consume more memory over time, potentially indicating a memory leak.

---

### **4. Investigate System Swap Settings**
- **Check Swap Usage**:
  If your system is running out of physical memory and using swap space, it might indicate insufficient physical memory. Check swap usage with:
  ```bash
  swapon --show
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  free -h
  ```
  - **If swap usage is high**, consider adding more physical memory or optimizing processes to reduce memory consumption.

- **Adjust Swappiness**:
  Swappiness controls how often the system swaps data from RAM to disk. You can adjust the swappiness value to make the system swap less aggressively:
  ```bash
  sysctl vm.swappiness=10
  ```
  This will make the system try to keep more data in RAM before swapping.

---

### **5. System Resource Limits**
- **Check Resource Limits (ulimit)**:
  Ensure that there are no hard limits for memory that could be causing processes to be killed due to excessive resource consumption. Check limits with:
  ```bash
  ulimit -a
  ```
  - If limits are too low, consider increasing them.

---

### **6. Analyze Memory Consumption with `pmap`**
- **Memory Map of Processes**:
  Use the `pmap` command to inspect memory usage by a process:
  ```bash
  pmap <PID>
  ```
  This will show the memory map for a specific process, and can help identify large memory regions (e.g., large files or shared memory).

---

### **7. Check for Specific Process Behavior**
- **Memory Usage Pattern**:
  - **Long-running processes**: Some processes may consume more memory as they run, especially if there is a memory leak. Use `ps`, `top`, or `htop` to observe how memory usage increases over time for certain processes.
  - **Examine logs for memory-intensive operations**: Some operations (e.g., large database queries, file processing) may temporarily use a large amount of memory. Reviewing logs can help pinpoint when these operations occur.

---

### **8. Investigate Configuration Issues**
- **Check for Misconfigured Applications**:
  Applications that don't have appropriate memory limits or caching mechanisms can easily consume all available memory. Review configuration files for services like databases, web servers, or custom applications to ensure they are correctly configured to manage memory.

- **Check for Docker/Kubernetes Issues (if applicable)**:
  If you are using containers, check the memory limits and usage for containers. A container running out of memory might cause the system to run out of memory as well. Use:
  ```bash
  docker stats
  ```
  or in Kubernetes:
  ```bash
  kubectl top pod
  ```

---

### **9. Review Kernel OOM Killer Behavior**
- **Tune OOM Killer Behavior**:
  The OOM killer might not always kill the right process. You can influence its behavior by setting `oom_adj` values for processes or using `oom_score_adj`:
  ```bash
  echo -1000 > /proc/<PID>/oom_score_adj
  ```
  - Adjusting the `oom_score_adj` can prioritize which processes the OOM killer terminates. This can be useful for preventing critical processes from being killed.

---

### **10. Set Up Alerts for Memory Usage**
- **Use `monit` or `Nagios`**:
  Set up a monitoring tool like `monit`, `Nagios`, or `Prometheus` to alert you when memory usage exceeds a certain threshold. This can help catch potential OOM conditions before they cause the system to shut down.
  Example:
  ```bash
  monit
  ```
  - Set up alerts for specific memory usage thresholds to give you early warnings.

---

### **11. Enable Early Warning Systems**
- **OOM Alerts in Syslog**:
  Set up OOM alerts via `syslog` to be notified when the OOM killer terminates a process:
  - Example configuration in `rsyslog` for OOM alerts:
    ```bash
    if ($programname == 'kernel' and $msg contains 'Out of memory') then {
        action(type="ommail" server="your-mail-server" to="admin@example.com" subject="OOM Alert")
    }
    ```

---

### **12. Check Application Code for Inefficient Memory Usage**
- **Profile Application Memory Usage**:
  If you suspect a specific application or service is responsible, profile it with debugging tools such as `gdb` (GNU Debugger) or `valgrind`. These tools can help identify memory leaks or inefficient memory allocation patterns.

---

### **13. Investigate Hardware Issues**
- **Check for faulty RAM**:
  If you frequently encounter OOM issues and can't link them to processes, you might have faulty RAM. Use `memtest86+` to check for hardware issues:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install memtest86+
  ```

---

By following this comprehensive approach, you can identify the root cause of your production host's OOM shutdowns, whether due to inefficient memory usage, misconfigured processes, or system-level issues. Addressing these will improve the stability and performance of your system.
