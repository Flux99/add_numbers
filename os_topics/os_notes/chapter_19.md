### Configuring Booting with GRUB

**Overview of GRUB**
- GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader) is used on Red Hat Enterprise Linux for managing the boot process.
- The initial part of the GRUB boot loader is installed in the master boot record (MBR), initiating the boot procedure for the operating system.

**Understanding the `grub.conf` Configuration File**
- The main configuration file for GRUB is located at `/boot/grub/grub.conf`.
- Below is a breakdown of a sample `grub.conf` file:

```
# grub.conf generated by anaconda
default=0
timeout=5
splashimage=(hd0,0)/grub/splash.xpm.gz
hiddenmenu

title Red Hat Enterprise Linux (2.6.32-220.el6.x86_64)
root (hd0,0)
kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.32-220.el6.x86_64 ro root=/dev/mapper/vg_hnl-lv_root
initrd /initramfs-2.6.32-220.el6.x86_64.img
```

#### Key Components of `grub.conf`
1. **Sections**:
   - Each section starts with a `title` line, which identifies the operating system to load.
   - The first line of each section specifies the root device using its BIOS name (e.g., `hd0,0` for the first partition on the first hard disk).

2. **Kernel Loading**:
   - The `kernel` line specifies the kernel file to load and includes various options for configuring its behavior:
     - **`ro`**: Mounts the root filesystem as read-only.
     - **`root=`**: Identifies the device containing the root filesystem (typically an LVM device).
     - **`quiet`**: Suppresses boot messages for a cleaner output.
     - **`rhgb`**: Activates the Red Hat Graphical Boot, hiding boot messages.
   - The `initrd` line specifies the initial RAM filesystem needed for booting.

3. **General Configuration Options**:
   - **`default`**: Indicates which section to load by default (0 for the first section).
   - **`timeout`**: Sets the time to wait before automatically booting the default OS, allowing users to enter the GRUB menu.
   - **`splashimage`**: Refers to a graphical background image for the GRUB menu.
   - **`hiddenmenu`**: Prevents the GRUB menu from being displayed, requiring the user to press Enter to access it.

4. **Security Enhancements**:
   - GRUB can be protected with a password to restrict access to the boot parameters, enhancing security, especially for physical server access.

### Exercise 19.1: Adding a GRUB Boot Password

**Objective**: To create an MD5 hashed password to protect GRUB.

#### Steps to Add a GRUB Password:
1. **Open a Root Shell**:
   - Gain root access to perform the changes.

2. **Generate Password Hash**:
   - Use the command `grub-md5-crypt` to create a password.
   - Enter and confirm the password when prompted.

3. **Copy the Hash**:
   - Copy the hashed password generated on-screen.

4. **Edit `grub.conf`**:
   - Open `/boot/grub/grub.conf` in a text editor.
   - Add the line `password=` and paste the hashed password next to it.
   - Example:
     ```
     password --md5 $1$6XWao0$98FkjAkEJWBB/
     ```

5. **Remove `hiddenmenu`**:
   - Delete the line containing `hiddenmenu` to make the GRUB menu visible during boot.

6. **Save Changes and Reboot**:
   - Save the `grub.conf` file and close the editor.
   - Restart the computer.

7. **Test the GRUB Password**:
   - When the GRUB menu appears, press `p` to enter password mode.
   - Enter the password to access the boot parameter modification interface.

8. **Proceed with Boot**:
   - After entering the password, you can modify boot options if needed, or simply press Enter to continue the normal boot process.

### Changing Boot Options with GRUB

Sometimes, your server may not boot normally due to issues such as an error in the GRUB configuration file or a need to enter maintenance mode. In such cases, you can change the GRUB parameters directly from the GRUB prompt. Here’s how to do it:

#### Reasons for Using GRUB Prompt:
- Errors in the `grub.conf` file preventing normal boot.
- Need to boot into maintenance mode due to boot problems.

### Accessing the GRUB Menu
To enter the GRUB menu during boot:
- **Hidden Menu:** Press the **Escape** key after POST and before the operating system starts.
- **Password-Protected Menu:** Press **p** and enter the GRUB password to unlock editing.
  
### Modifying Boot Parameters
From the GRUB menu, you have several options:
- Press **a** to change only the boot parameters for the kernel (e.g., switching runlevels).
- Press **e** to edit the lines from the configuration file if you suspect an error.
- Press **c** to open the GRUB command line for manual entry of parameters (more complex but powerful).

### Editing GRUB Parameters
To modify GRUB parameters:
1. Select the GRUB menu entry to modify and press **e**.
2. In the edit menu, select the line to change and press **e** again to edit.
3. Use arrow keys to navigate, or Bash-like shortcuts (e.g., **Ctrl+a** to go to the beginning of a line).
4. Make your changes and press **Enter** to return to the main edit menu.
5. From the main menu, press **b** to boot your server.

#### Important Note:
Any changes made in the GRUB editor are temporary. After booting, ensure you modify the `grub.conf` file to make the changes permanent.

### Other Edit Options
In the edit menu, you can also:
- Press **d** to delete a line.
- Press **o** to open a line for editing.
- Press **Escape** to return to the main GRUB menu.

### Exercise: Booting with Alternative Options
In this exercise, you will intentionally create a boot error and fix it using the GRUB editor.

#### Steps:
1. Boot your server and open a root shell.
2. Edit `/boot/grub/grub.conf` and change the word `root` to `rot` in the kernel loading line, then reboot.
3. Observe the boot process; it will halt with a panic message.
4. Power off the server and reboot. Enter the GRUB menu.
5. If prompted for a password, press **p** and enter it. Then press **e** to enter editor mode.
6. Select the kernel line, press **e** to edit, navigate to the error, and correct it.
7. Press **Enter** to confirm, then **b** to boot the server.
8. After booting, log in as root and edit `/boot/grub/menu.lst` to correct the kernel line permanently.

### **Exercise 19.3: Manually Starting GRUB**

In this exercise, you'll manually start GRUB. This procedure is useful for repairing a damaged GRUB installation.

1. **Restart Your Computer:**
   - When the GRUB menu displays, type `p` to enter the password (if prompted).
   - After entering the password, press `c` to open the GRUB shell.

2. **Read the GRUB Configuration File:**
   - Type: 
     ```bash
     cat /grub/grub.conf
     ```
   - This command attempts to read the GRUB configuration file. If successful, it displays the current configuration.

3. **Enter Boot Parameters:**
   - Type: 
     ```bash
     root (hd0,0)
     ```

4. **Load the Kernel:**
   - Type: 
     ```bash
     kernel vmlinuz-[tab] ro root=/your/root/filesystem
     ```
   - Press `Tab` to auto-complete the kernel version.

5. **Load the Initial RAM Disk:**
   - Type: 
     ```bash
     initrd /initramfs-[tab]
     ```

6. **Boot the System:**
   - Type: 
     ```bash
     boot
     ```
   - Press Enter, and your computer will start.

### **Reinstalling GRUB**

If your GRUB configuration is severely damaged, you may need to reinstall GRUB.

#### **Methods of Reinstallation**
1. **From the GRUB Shell:**
   - Use the command:
     ```bash
     setup (hd0)
     ```
   - This installs GRUB in the master boot record of your computer.

2. **From a Bash Shell:**
   - Alternatively, you can use the `grub-install` command from a Bash shell, either on a running system or from a rescue disk.

---

### **GRUB Behind the Scenes**

Understanding how GRUB operates can help you manage it effectively.

- **GRUB Parts:**
  - The first part, installed in the Master Boot Record (MBR), is called the **GRUB stage 1 boot loader** (446 bytes).
  - The second part is the **stage 2 GRUB**, located in the first megabyte of the disk, which allows GRUB to read files directly from the file system.

- **Important File:**
  - `/boot/grub/device.map` contains the mapping between kernel device names and BIOS device names. Misconfigurations here can lead to boot issues.

- **Checking GRUB Presence:**
  - You can verify GRUB's presence in the MBR using:
    ```bash
    xxd -l 512 /dev/sda
    ```
  - This command displays the contents of the MBR, allowing you to see GRUB error messages.

---

### **GRUB 2**

- GRUB is used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, while GRUB 2 has replaced it in recent versions of Fedora and will be introduced in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.
- GRUB 2 is organized differently, offering enhanced features and capabilities.

### Common Kernel Management Tasks in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6

**Overview of Kernel and GRUB**  
The primary responsibility of GRUB (the Grand Unified Bootloader) is to load the Linux kernel, which is the core of the operating system and directly interacts with hardware components. To facilitate this interaction, the kernel utilizes `initrd` (initial RAM disk), which contains the necessary components to access the filesystem from which additional modules can be loaded.

As a system administrator, you may need to perform several tasks related to kernel module management, particularly for hardware support. While most modern Linux distributions, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6, automatically load the appropriate kernel drivers, there are scenarios where you might need to intervene manually.

### Key Kernel Management Tasks

1. **Analyze Kernel Modules**:
   - Verify whether a specific module is loaded.
   - Check for available kernel modules related to specific hardware components.

2. **Load and Unload Kernel Modules**:
   - Manually load or unload modules when necessary.
   - Use commands like `modprobe`, `lsmod`, and `modinfo` for module management.

3. **Load Modules with Specific Options**:
   - Some drivers may require specific parameters or options for optimal performance or functionality.

### Analyzing Availability of Kernel Modules

To check if a specific kernel module is loaded, use the `lspci -v` command, which provides detailed information about devices on the PCI bus, including which kernel driver is in use. Here's an example of the output you might see:

```bash
[root@hnl ~]# lspci -v | less
00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation 2nd Generation Core Processor Family
DRAM Controller (rev 09)
Kernel driver in use: agpgart-intel
...
00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Integrated Graphics Controller
Kernel driver in use: i915
Kernel modules: i915
```

If you need to diagnose hardware issues, the `dmesg` command is invaluable. It reads the kernel ring buffer, displaying messages related to kernel operations, including new device initialization:

```bash
usb 2-1.4: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3
Initializing USB Mass Storage driver...
usb-storage: device found at 3
...
```

### Loading and Unloading Kernel Modules

Although the kernel typically manages module loading automatically, you might need to load or unload modules manually. Use the following commands:

- **Load a module**:  
  ```bash
  modprobe [module_name]
  ```
- **Unload a module**:  
  ```bash
  modprobe -r [module_name]
  ```

To list currently loaded modules, use:

```bash
lsmod
```

### Loading Kernel Modules with Specific Options

Kernel modules can often be loaded with specific options to enable desired features. To find out which options are available for a particular module, use:

```bash
modinfo [module_name]
```

You’ll see a list of parameters that can be set for the module. For instance, the `i915` module might show options like `modeset`, `fbpercrtc`, and others.

To set module options, create a configuration file in `/etc/modprobe.d`. The filename should end with `.conf`, and you can specify options in the following format:

```bash
options [module_name] [option_name]=[value]
```

**Example**: To disable the auto-eject feature of a CD-ROM drive:

1. Check available parameters:
   ```bash
   modinfo cdrom
   ```
2. Create the configuration file:
   ```bash
   echo "options cdrom autoeject=0" > /etc/modprobe.d/cdrom.conf
   ```

3. Reload the module:
   ```bash
   modprobe -r cdrom
   modprobe cdrom
   ```

### Exercise: Applying Kernel Module Options

In this exercise, you will modify the CD-ROM kernel module to disable the auto-eject feature.

1. **Insert a CD-ROM**: This will mount the CD automatically.
2. **Check module options**:
   ```bash
   modinfo cdrom
   ```
3. **Create configuration file**:
   ```bash
   echo "options cdrom autoeject=0" > /etc/modprobe.d/cdrom.conf
   ```
4. **Unload the CD-ROM module**: If it fails, ensure the CD is unmounted or reboot the system.
   ```bash
   modprobe -r cdrom
   ```
5. **Load the module again**:
   ```bash
   modprobe cdrom
   ```
6. **Reinsert the CD**: Confirm that the auto-eject feature is now disabled.

### Conclusion

Managing kernel modules is a fundamental skill for Linux system administrators. Understanding how to analyze, load, and configure these modules ensures that the system can effectively utilize hardware components. By leveraging commands like `lspci`, `dmesg`, `modprobe`, and `lsmod`, you can maintain control over the kernel's interaction with hardware.




### Configuring Service Startup with Upstart

#### Overview of Upstart

Upstart was introduced as an event-driven replacement for the traditional System V init system. While it aimed to improve the speed of service startup—particularly in desktop environments—it is still relevant in server contexts, especially for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6, where it is the default init system. However, it's worth noting that systemd is rapidly becoming the standard for most Linux distributions.

#### Key Features of Upstart

- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Upstart starts services based on events rather than sequentially, allowing for potentially faster boot times.
- **Script-Based Configuration:** Configuration files located in `/etc/init` define how services are started and managed.
- **Compatibility with Runlevels:** Upstart maintains compatibility with traditional runlevels, allowing administrators to manage services similarly to previous init systems.

#### Configuration Files

1. **/etc/inittab**: While still present, this file serves mainly as a reference for Upstart's operation and defines the default runlevel. For example, the line:
   ```
   id:5:initdefault:
   ```
   sets the default runlevel to 5 (graphical mode). To switch to a non-graphical mode, you can change this to 3.

2. **/etc/init/rcS.conf**: This script is responsible for system initialization and includes the essential line that starts the `rc.sysinit` script, which mounts filesystems and initializes swap space.

3. **/etc/init/rc.conf**: This script handles the starting of services for the defined runlevel. It processes symbolic links in `/etc/rcX.d` (where X corresponds to the current runlevel) to start services.

#### Service Management

- Services are typically managed through scripts located in `/etc/init.d`, which can be started with commands like:
  ```bash
  service nameofthescript start
  ```

- Upstart executes symbolic links starting with `S` in the relevant `/etc/rcX.d` directory during boot. For instance, in runlevel 3, the first executed script might be `/etc/rc3.d/S01sysstat`, with the last being `/etc/rc3.d/S99local`.

- If you switch runlevels, Upstart will execute scripts starting with `K` to stop services that are no longer needed.

#### Additional Scripts

A few other scripts are executed after processing runlevels, such as:
- **/etc/init/start-ttys.conf**: Prepares TTYs for user access.
- **prefdm.conf**: Starts the graphical display manager if a graphical environment is in use.

#### Practical Use as an Administrator

As an administrator of a RHEL server, understanding Upstart's structure and function is valuable, particularly when diagnosing issues related to service startup or boot failures. While day-to-day operations might not require frequent interaction with Upstart scripts, knowledge of the system allows for effective troubleshooting and configuration.

If you encounter issues after installing a service, knowing how Upstart operates can help you address misconfigurations in the startup scripts.


Here's a structured overview of basic Red Hat Enterprise Linux troubleshooting, specifically focusing on boot-related issues, including starting in minimal mode and resetting the root password. This summary will capture the essential steps and techniques described in the original text.

# Basic Red Hat Enterprise Linux Troubleshooting

## Common Issues
While Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) servers are generally reliable, boot-related problems can occasionally arise, particularly due to service issues during startup. Understanding how to troubleshoot these problems is crucial.

## Booting in Minimal Mode
There are two main minimal modes to help diagnose boot problems:

### 1. Runlevel 1 (Single-User Mode)
- **Purpose**: Used for troubleshooting when issues are suspected in runlevels.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Starts essential services.
  - Minimal services are running (viewable in `/etc/rc1.d` for services starting with S).

### 2. Init=/bin/bash
- **Purpose**: Use when problems are suspected in the initial boot phase.
- **How to Enter**:
  1. Restart the server.
  2. At the GRUB menu, press `a` to enter the kernel argument.
  3. Type `init=/bin/bash` to bypass the Upstart procedure.

### Using the Shell
1. **Creating a File**:
   - Command: `touch blah`
   - **Expected Error**: Read-only file system.
2. **Remounting the Root File System**:
   - Command: `mount -o remount,rw /` to change it to read-write mode.
3. **Accessing Other File Systems**:
   - Command: `mount -a` to mount all file systems.
   - **Note**: Some file systems may produce error messages.
4. **Returning to Normal Mode**:
   - Command: `exec /sbin/init` to start the server normally.

### Interactive Mode
- Press `I` while services load to start scripts one by one, allowing for troubleshooting of specific services.

### Best Practice
Start with runlevel 1 for easier troubleshooting before using `init=/bin/bash`.

## No Root Password?
- Entering `init=/bin/bash` doesn’t require a root password, as this is a feature, not a security leak.
- Always ensure physical security for server access.

## Resetting the Root Password
If the root password is unknown, follow these steps:

1. **Enter Runlevel 1**:
   - Reboot the server and press `a` at the GRUB menu.
   - Append `1` to the kernel line to enter runlevel 1.
2. **Set SELinux to Permissive Mode**:
   - Command: `setenforce 0`.
3. **Reset the Root Password**:
   - Command: `passwd` and enter the new password.

## Using a Rescue Environment
If you can't start GRUB or access the kernel, using a rescue environment is essential.

### Starting a Rescue System
1. **Insert the Installation Disc**:
   - Reboot the server.
2. **Boot from the DVD**:
   - From the DVD menu, select **Rescue Installed System**.
3. **Select Language and Keyboard**:
   - Choose English and your keyboard type.
4. **Select Media Type**:
   - Choose **Local CD/DVD** when prompted for media containing the rescue image.
5. **Setup Networking**:
   - Select **No** for networking unless necessary.
6. **Continue to Find the Installation**:
   - Press Enter to select **Continue**, which will mount your installation to `/mnt/sysimage`.
7. **Confirm Mounting**:
   - Acknowledge successful discovery and mounting of your current installation.
8. **Access Shell**:
   - Select the shell option to open a Bash shell.
9. **Change Root Directory**:
   - Command: `chroot /mnt/sysimage` to set the root of your installation as the current root.
