### Summary: Disk Drive Interface and Geometry

#### **Disk Drive Interface**
1. **Sector-Based Access**:
   - Modern disk drives are structured as an array of sectors (512-byte blocks).
   - Sectors are addressed sequentially from 0 to \( n-1 \), where \( n \) is the total number of sectors on the disk.

2. **Multi-Sector Operations**:
   - Commonly, file systems read/write larger chunks (e.g., 4KB), but only single 512-byte writes are guaranteed to be atomic. 
   - In case of power loss, partial writes for larger chunks can occur, referred to as "torn writes."

3. **Performance Assumptions**:
   - Accessing blocks closer in address space is faster than accessing those further apart.
   - Sequential access (reading/writing contiguous blocks) is significantly faster than random access.

#### **Disk Geometry**
1. **Platters**:
   - Circular hard surfaces store data magnetically.
   - A disk can have multiple platters, each with two surfaces.

2. **Spindle and RPM**:
   - Platters are mounted on a spindle connected to a motor, which rotates them at a constant rate (e.g., 7,200 to 15,000 RPM).
   - Single rotation time example: At 10,000 RPM, one rotation takes ~6 milliseconds.

3. **Tracks and Surfaces**:
   - Data is stored in concentric circles called **tracks** on each surface.
   - Thousands of tightly packed tracks exist per surface, with hundreds fitting into the width of a human hair.

4. **Heads and Arms**:
   - Each surface has a **disk head** to read/write magnetic patterns.
   - Heads are attached to a **disk arm**, which positions them over the desired track for operation.

This structured organization and operational efficiency make modern disk drives a reliable and performance-optimized storage medium.




### Summary: Understanding Disk Drives and Performance Metrics

**1. Basics of a Simple Disk Drive**  
- A simple disk consists of **one track with 12 sectors**, each 512 bytes in size, addressed 0 through 11.  
- A **disk head** attached to a motor rotates counter-clockwise over the disk platter to read/write data.

**2. Single-Track Latency (Rotational Delay)**  
- **Rotational delay** is the time the disk waits for the desired sector to rotate under the disk head.  
- Example: Reading block 0 when the head is at sector 6 requires half a full rotation (\(R/2\)).  
- **Worst-case delay**: Nearly a full rotation for the farthest sector.

**3. Multi-Track Drives and Seek Time**  
- **Seek Time**: Time to move the disk arm to the correct track. This has multiple phases:  
  - **Acceleration**, **coasting**, **deceleration**, and **settling** (to precisely position the head).  
  - Settling time can take 0.5 to 2 milliseconds.
- Example: To read sector 11 from a different track, the arm seeks the outermost track, and then rotational delay positions the head over the desired sector.

**4. I/O Time Components**  
- Total I/O time comprises:  
  1. **Seek time**  
  2. **Rotational delay**  
  3. **Transfer time** (reading/writing data to/from the surface).  

**5. Additional Concepts**  
- **Track Skew**: Sectors on adjacent tracks are offset to prevent rotational delays when crossing tracks.  
- **Multi-Zoned Drives**: Outer tracks hold more sectors due to larger circumference, organized into **zones** where each has a consistent number of sectors per track.  
- **Disk Cache**: Modern drives use cache (8–16 MB) to improve performance.  
  - **Write-back caching** acknowledges writes after storing them in memory (faster but riskier).  
  - **Write-through caching** ensures data is written to disk before acknowledgment (safer).  

**6. Dimensional Analysis**  
- A systematic way to calculate disk performance metrics:  
  - **Example**: For a 10,000 RPM disk, time per rotation is calculated as:  
    \[
    \text{Time per Rotation} = \frac{60,000 \text{ ms}}{10,000 \text{ Rotations}} = 6 \text{ ms/Rotation}.
    \]  
  - **Transfer time** example:  
    To transfer a 512 KB block with a transfer rate of 100 MB/s:  
    \[
    \text{Transfer Time} = \frac{512 \text{ KB}}{100 \text{ MB/s}} \cdot 1000 = 5 \text{ ms}.
    \]  

By understanding these fundamentals, one can analyze disk performance and design efficient systems to manage I/O operations.





### Summary: Understanding I/O Time and Disk Performance

**I/O Time Components**  
I/O performance can be analyzed using the formula:  
**Tₒ = T_seek + T_rotation + T_transfer**  
Where:  
- **T_seek**: Time for the disk arm to reach the desired track.  
- **T_rotation**: Time for the desired sector to rotate under the read/write head.  
- **T_transfer**: Time to move data from disk to memory.  

**Key Insights on Workloads**  
- **Random Workload**: Small, random reads (e.g., 4 KB) are common in applications like databases. These are slow due to frequent seeks and rotations.  
- **Sequential Workload**: Large, contiguous reads (e.g., 100 MB) are faster because only one seek and rotation are needed before continuous data transfer.  

**Disk Drive Comparison**  
Two types of drives highlight the trade-off between performance and capacity:  
1. **Cheetah 15K.5 (High-Performance Drive)**  
   - **RPM**: 15,000  
   - **Average Seek Time**: 4 ms  
   - **Max Transfer Rate**: 125 MB/s  
   - **I/O Performance**:  
     - Random Workload: 0.66 MB/s  
     - Sequential Workload: 125 MB/s  

2. **Barracuda (Capacity Drive)**  
   - **RPM**: 7,200  
   - **Average Seek Time**: 9 ms  
   - **Max Transfer Rate**: 105 MB/s  
   - **I/O Performance**:  
     - Random Workload: 0.31 MB/s  
     - Sequential Workload: 105 MB/s  

**Performance Insights**  
- **Random vs. Sequential**: Sequential workloads are far more efficient, with up to 200–300x better performance than random workloads.  
- **High-Performance vs. Capacity Drives**: High-performance drives have faster seeks, rotations, and transfer rates, making them suitable for I/O-intensive tasks, while capacity drives focus on cost-effectiveness.

**Design Tips**  
1. Prefer **sequential access** over random access to minimize performance overhead.  
2. For unavoidable random workloads, use large transfer sizes to reduce overhead.  
3. Select a drive type that aligns with workload needs—high-performance drives for speed, capacity drives for storage.  

### Additional Notes  
The difference in performance between random and sequential workloads and between high-performance and capacity drives underscores the importance of workload-specific disk usage strategies in system design.





### Disk Scheduling Summary

Disk scheduling determines the order of I/O requests to optimize disk performance, addressing seek time, rotational delay, and potential starvation. Various algorithms have been developed to balance efficiency and fairness.

#### **Key Disk Scheduling Algorithms**

1. **Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)**  
   - **How it works**: Picks the I/O request with the nearest track to minimize seek time.  
   - **Example**: If the head is on the inner track and requests are for tracks 21 (middle) and 2 (outer), SSTF services track 21 first, then track 2.  
   - **Challenges**:
     - Starvation: A steady stream of requests to nearby tracks can indefinitely delay others.  
     - Solution: Use **Nearest Block First (NBF)** instead, which operates on logical block addresses rather than physical geometry.  

2. **SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)**  
   - **How it works**: Moves back and forth across tracks, servicing requests in order. Requests for already-serviced tracks are queued for the next sweep.  
   - **Variants**:
     - **F-SCAN**: Freezes the queue during a sweep, delaying late-arriving requests to avoid starvation.  
     - **C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)**: Sweeps in one direction (e.g., outer-to-inner), resets to the outer track, and starts again. Fairer for inner and outer tracks as it avoids repeated middle track prioritization.  

3. **Shortest Positioning Time First (SPTF)**  
   - **How it works**: Considers both seek time and rotational delay to select the next request.  
   - **Example**: If the head is on sector 30 (inner track) with requests for sector 16 (middle track) and sector 8 (outer track), the decision depends on whether seek time or rotational delay is more significant.  
     - If seeks are slower: Service sector 16 first.  
     - If seeks are faster: Service sector 8, even with a longer seek, to minimize total delay.

---

#### **Crucial Considerations**
1. **Starvation Prevention**  
   - Algorithms like SCAN and F-SCAN ensure fairness by cycling through tracks systematically, preventing requests from being ignored.  

2. **Balancing Seek vs. Rotation Costs**  
   - SPTF optimizes performance by integrating both seek and rotation delays into scheduling decisions, aligning closely with Shortest Job First (SJF) principles.

---

### Practical Insights
- SSTF works well in simple scenarios but struggles with fairness due to potential starvation.  
- SCAN and its variants address starvation effectively but may not always optimize performance for every workload.  
- SPTF offers the best theoretical performance by considering both key delays, though its complexity may not suit all systems.  

Disk scheduling remains a critical component of system performance, with algorithm choice depending on workload characteristics and fairness requirements.





### Summary of Disk Scheduling and Modern Disk Management

Disk scheduling in operating systems optimizes the order of I/O requests to reduce the high cost of I/O operations. Historically, operating systems decided the scheduling, but modern drives handle much of this internally. Here's a breakdown of key concepts:

---

### **Disk Scheduling Algorithms**
1. **SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First):**
   - Orders requests based on proximity to the current head position.
   - Example: Requests for sectors 21 and 2 when the head is on the inner track would prioritize 21 (middle track).
   - **Issues:** 
     - **Starvation:** Continuous requests to one region may block others indefinitely.
     - Does not account for rotational delays, focusing only on seek time.

2. **SCAN and Variants (Elevator Algorithms):**
   - SCAN sweeps across the disk (inner to outer or vice versa) servicing requests in order.
   - Variants:
     - **F-SCAN:** Freezes the request queue during a sweep, preventing starvation of distant requests.
     - **C-SCAN:** Sweeps in one direction (outer-to-inner) and resets, offering fairness to inner and outer tracks.
   - Advantage: Reduces starvation and balances servicing across tracks.

3. **SPTF (Shortest Positioning Time First):**
   - Considers both seek time and rotational delays for more accurate scheduling.
   - Example: If rotation dominates, it may prioritize farther tracks with shorter rotational delays over closer tracks with longer delays.
   - Challenges: Implementation in OS is difficult due to limited visibility of disk head position and track layout. It is mostly handled within modern disk drives.

---

### **Modern Disk Scheduling Features**
1. **Internal Drive Schedulers:**
   - Modern disks manage multiple outstanding requests.
   - Disks implement SPTF internally, leveraging precise knowledge of head position and track layout.

2. **I/O Merging:**
   - Combines sequential requests (e.g., blocks 33 and 34) into a single request to reduce overhead and improve efficiency.

3. **Anticipatory Scheduling:**
   - Delays processing requests to wait for potentially better requests.
   - Balances efficiency gains with complexity in determining wait times.

---

### **Additional Notes**
- Modern OS disk schedulers focus on submitting a small batch of requests (e.g., 16) to the disk, leaving detailed scheduling to the disk itself.
- Anticipatory scheduling is a non-work-conserving approach shown to improve overall performance but requires careful tuning.

This functional understanding of disks allows us to design systems that leverage their capabilities effectively, without delving into the intricate physics and engineering behind them.
