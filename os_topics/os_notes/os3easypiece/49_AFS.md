### **The Andrew File System (AFS)**

**Introduction:**
- **Developed** at Carnegie-Mellon University (CMU) in the 1980s.
- Led by Professor M. Satyanarayanan ("Satya").
- **Primary Goal**: Scalability – enabling a server to support a large number of clients efficiently.

---

### **Design Philosophy and Differences from NFS:**
1. **Protocol Design for Scalability:**
   - NFS: Clients frequently check with the server for cache consistency, consuming server resources (CPU, network bandwidth).
   - AFS: Simplifies cache consistency by ensuring that clients receive the latest file copy upon opening.

2. **User-Visible Behavior:**
   - AFS offers a simpler and clearer cache consistency model compared to NFS.
   - AFS guarantees that a client receives the latest version of the file when it is opened.

---

### **AFS Version 1 (AFSv1):**
- **Features:**
  - Introduced basic design principles of AFS.
  - Implemented **whole-file caching**:
    - On `open()`: Entire file fetched from the server and cached locally.
    - Reads and writes operate locally without network communication.
    - On `close()`: If the file is modified, it is sent back to the server for permanent storage.

- **Client-Server Communication:**
  - **Fetch Protocol**: Fetches the file using its pathname (e.g., `/home/user/file.txt`).
  - **Store Protocol**: Sends back the modified file to the server with its pathname.
  - **TestAuth Protocol**: Used to check if the locally cached file is still valid.

- **Local Caching Hierarchy:**
  - Cached files are stored on the client’s local disk.
  - File blocks are cached in client memory when accessed.

- **Directory Caching:**
  - AFSv1 did not cache directory contents locally. Directories were only stored on the server.

---

### **Key Problems with AFSv1:**
1. **Path-Traversal Overhead:**
   - Each Fetch/Store request required full pathname traversal on the server.
   - Example: To locate `/home/user/file.txt`, the server would navigate:
     - Root directory → `home` → `user` → `file.txt`.
   - This consumed significant server CPU time, especially with many concurrent clients.

2. **Excessive Validation Requests:**
   - The TestAuth protocol generated high traffic as clients frequently checked the validity of cached files.
   - Most responses indicated no change, leading to unnecessary resource usage.

3. **Other Issues:**
   - **Load Imbalance**: Servers became overloaded due to uneven distribution of client requests.
     - Solution: Introduced **volumes**, allowing administrators to redistribute load across servers.
   - **Server Overheads**:
     - AFSv1 used a separate process per client, causing excessive context switching.
     - Solution: AFSv2 used threads instead of processes for efficiency.

### **Protocol Highlights in AFSv1:**
| **Protocol**   | **Purpose**                                           |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **TestAuth**   | Validates if a cached file has changed.               |
| **GetFileStat**| Fetches file metadata (e.g., size, permissions).       |
| **Fetch**      | Retrieves the entire file from the server.            |
| **Store**      | Saves the modified file back to the server.           |
| **SetFileStat**| Updates file metadata on the server.                  |
| **ListDir**    | Lists contents of a directory.                        |

### **Takeaways:**
- **Whole-File Caching**: Improved local performance by minimizing network communication during reads/writes.
- **Scalability Bottlenecks**: 
  - Server-side pathname traversal and frequent client validation checks limited scalability.
- **Solutions Introduced in AFSv2**:
  - **Path-Traversal Optimization**: Likely addressed by caching directory metadata or hierarchical improvements.
  - **Protocol Optimization**: Reduced unnecessary TestAuth checks.
  - **Server Efficiency**: Threads replaced processes to reduce overhead.
  - **Load Balancing**: Volumes distributed workload across servers.

---

### **Patterson’s Law (Design Philosophy):**
- Measure the system to identify problems before implementing fixes.
- Benefits:
  1. Confirms that real problems are being addressed.
  2. Establishes metrics to evaluate improvements in the new system.

**Example in AFS Development:**
- The AFS team measured AFSv1's performance and identified bottlenecks (path-traversal costs, excessive TestAuth traffic).
- This evidence-driven approach informed the design of AFSv2.

### **Study Tips:**
1. Focus on understanding **whole-file caching** and its contrast with NFS block caching.
2. Memorize the **protocol highlights** and their purposes.
3. Pay attention to the **problems with AFSv1** and how AFSv2 addressed them.
4. Reflect on the importance of **Patterson’s Law** in system design.



The text discusses improvements made to the Andrew File System (AFS) in its second version (AFSv2) to address scalability and efficiency concerns. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

### Problems in AFSv1
1. **Server Bottlenecks**:
   - Servers became overwhelmed by frequent `TestAuth` messages.
   - Excessive overhead from traversing directory hierarchies during file access.

2. **Scalability Issues**:
   - Each server could handle only about 20 clients before becoming overloaded.

---

### Improvements in AFSv2
1. **Callbacks**:
   - Introduced as a mechanism to reduce server-client interactions.
   - **Callback Functionality**:
     - The server promises to notify the client when a cached file is modified.
     - Clients assume the cached file is valid until explicitly notified of changes.
     - Reduces the need for constant validation (like polling).

2. **File Identifier (FID)**:
   - Replaced pathnames with FIDs, which include:
     - Volume identifier.
     - File identifier.
     - A "uniquifier" to prevent ID reuse after file deletions.
   - **Benefit**:
     - Clients traverse and cache directory paths incrementally.
     - Avoids server-intensive pathname traversals.

---

### File Access in AFSv2
- **Initial Access**:
  - Involves multiple `Fetch` messages to cache directory and file data and establish callbacks.
  - For example:
    1. Fetch `/home` directory → cache it and set callback.
    2. Fetch `/home/remzi` directory → cache it and set callback.
    3. Fetch `/home/remzi/notes.txt` → cache it and set callback.
  - Subsequent accesses are local if the file hasn’t changed, mimicking local disk performance.

---

### Cache Consistency in AFS
1. **Cross-Machine Consistency**:
   - Server invalidates cached copies by breaking callbacks when a file is updated.
   - Clients re-fetch updated files upon next access.

2. **Same-Machine Consistency**:
   - Writes are immediately visible to local processes, adhering to UNIX-like behavior.

3. **Concurrency and the "Last Writer Wins" Model**:
   - Updates from the last client to close a file overwrite previous changes.
   - Ensures file coherence but may cause conflicts in concurrent scenarios.

4. **NFS Comparison**:
   - AFS caches entire files and ensures updates are consistent across clients.
   - NFS operates at the block level, potentially mixing updates from multiple clients, which may produce invalid results (e.g., corrupted images).

---

### Summary
AFSv2 significantly improved scalability by:
- Reducing unnecessary server interactions with callbacks.
- Offloading pathname resolution to clients using FIDs.

These changes optimized server performance and made the system more efficient and scalable for larger client bases. However, as with any distributed system, developers must still handle concurrent access explicitly to prevent conflicts.

The text you've provided dives into the complexities of **crash recovery** and **workload performance comparisons** between the Andrew File System (AFS) and Network File System (NFS). Here's a summary and analysis:

---

### **Crash Recovery**
1. **AFS**:
   - When a **client** reboots:
     - It might miss callback messages (e.g., invalidations for cached files).
     - The client must validate its cache with the server before using any cached files.
   - When a **server** reboots:
     - Server loses callback state (stored in memory).
     - All clients must invalidate their caches and revalidate data upon reconnecting to the server.
     - Recovery mechanisms include:
       - Servers broadcasting invalidation messages after restart.
       - Clients periodically checking the server's status (heartbeat mechanism).

2. **NFS**:
   - NFS does not maintain strong consistency, so clients are largely unaffected by server crashes.
   - Simpler crash recovery as no client-server cache synchronization is needed post-crash.

---

### **Workload Performance Comparison**
The performance of AFS and NFS varies based on workload scenarios. Key takeaways include:

1. **Small File Reads/Writes**:
   - Both systems perform similarly due to caching.
   - AFS writes to a local disk (leveraging client-side OS caching), while NFS buffers writes in memory.

2. **Large File Sequential Re-reads**:
   - AFS is faster as it leverages its local disk cache.
   - NFS re-fetches the file from the server if it's larger than client memory, increasing network traffic.

3. **Large File Overwrites**:
   - AFS suffers because it fetches the entire file before overwriting.
   - NFS avoids this overhead by writing directly to the relevant blocks.

4. **Access to Small Subsets of Large Files**:
   - NFS is more efficient as it fetches and writes only the required blocks.
   - AFS fetches and writes the entire file, causing significant overhead.

---

### **Scale and Performance of AFSv2**
- AFSv2 improved scalability, supporting up to **50 clients per server** (up from 20).
- Performance gains for **local operations**:
  - Most file operations were handled locally, reducing server load.
  - Writes were deferred to the server until files were closed, minimizing network usage.

---

### **Workload Design Implications**
1. **AFS**:
   - Optimized for workloads with sequential and non-shared access patterns.
   - Struggles with random updates or small changes in large files (e.g., appending to logs or transaction databases).

2. **NFS**:
   - Performs better in workloads with block-level updates and sparse file access.

---

### **Key Observations**
- **AFS** trades simplicity for scalability and performance in certain cases but comes with increased complexity in crash recovery and specific workload scenarios.
- **NFS** is simpler and performs better under random access or partial file operations but is less efficient for sequential reads of large files with multiple clients.
