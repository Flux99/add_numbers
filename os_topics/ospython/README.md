- 32-Search_rotating_array
- 35-Median_of_2_sorte_arrays

# Tries:
59 ->  This is a really tricky one.A dfs implementation that can be refined with early stopping mechanism. I had to watch vids about advanced tries for that...

# Linked List:
- 32 - Reverse linked list
- 34 - Reorder list
- 39 - Find duplicate number
- 40 - LRU cache
- 42 - Reverse K Groups

# Tree
- 45- Diameter of binary Tree

- 55-Construct_Binary_Tree_From_Preorder_And_Inorder_Traversal

# Backtracking
- 67-subsets
- 69-permutations
- 70=subset-2 -> really tricky as the rule of the exercise are arguably wrong...

# Heap
- 63 - Cooling down ->We need to see the heaps there...
- 64 - Kth_largest
- 66 - FindMedian -> Heaps obvious but try to redo all computation on paper pls

# Math & Geometry

- Plus one -> just for the pleasure of over-engineering it.

# Graphs
- 76-Visited_island
- 78 - Max area island : Need to study the BFS again
- 86 - union find but I also want to find something else a bit more BFS style...

# 1-D Dynamic Programming:
- 95-Climbing stairs

# 2-D Dynamic Programming
-107- Unique Paths
